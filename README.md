As you can see in the tittle, my name is **Lionel Floriani**. I am surviving the earth since **1996** and started this journey in **Li√®ge**. I like everything that involves _creativity_ and _reflexion_. My favorites sports share the same name (hint: ‚öΩÔ∏è/üèà).

My most suprising skills :

-   Buccal trumpet
-   I run very fast
-   Burping on command

TOP3 things I like the most in the universe :

-   Finishing TOP1 in any Battle Royal game
-   Sleeping
-   You

One of my main goal as a student/developer @BeCode is to gain a lot of skills. I want to be the best version of myself. I really like coding; I'm super excited to be here at BeCode and find a job in IT !

I'm a bit afraid of the pace that we will have to follow during those 7 months of formation. But I guess we will get used to it pretty fast.

I'm looking forward to learn complex things/concepts, to work as a team on projects and simply working on real world projects.

Working as a team, I value :

-   Leadership
-   Communication
-   Group cohesion
